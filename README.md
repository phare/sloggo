# Sloggo

Sloggo is a minimalist logging receiver and viewer tool designed to handle a moderate amount of logs efficiently and provide a simple interface for exploring them. It supports receiving Syslog RFC 5424 logs and storing them in a lightweight SQLite database that fits in a single lightweight Docker container.

> [!WARNING]
> Sloggo does not offer any security layer by default, only use it in a private network, or behind a secure reverse proxy.

The UI is based on OpenStatus' [data table filter](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/data-table-filters) ðŸ«¶.
